    <h1>Parmesan Cream Sauce</h1>
    <p>This sauce is perfect for the Creamy Shrimp Pasta!</p>
<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
    <li>*double all ingredients to serve with 1 pound pasta</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon (tbl) salted butter</li>
    <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup of 2% milk</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon (tsp) kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<strong>Instructions</strong>
<ol>
    <li>Measure out all ingredients in advance; the cooking process happens fast! If serving with pasta, cook 8 ounces pasta while you make the sauce.</li>
    <li>In a small or medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the grated garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant but not browned.</li>
    <li>Add the flour and whisk constantly for 1 minute to 90 seconds, until bubbly and golden. Do not overcook it: the flour can turn brown within a few seconds. Keep an eye on it!</li>
    <li>Add a splash of milk and whisk it in: the sauce will instantly turn chunky. Constantly whisking, continue to add splashes of milk and whisk them in until the entire quantity is incorporated and the sauce is smooth.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat and whisk until the sauce thickens and no longer tastes like raw flour, about 5 minutes. Add the salt and Parmesan cheese. Taste and add a pinch or two more salt if desired.</li>
    <li>If serving with pasta, drain the pasta, then add the sauce. Add a splash or two of milk to loosen the sauce and come to just the right creamy consistency. Taste and a few more pinches of salt, if necessary. (The sauce is best freshly made, so we donâ€™t recommend making it in advance).</li>
</ol>
