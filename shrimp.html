    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (lb) large shrimp, deveined</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (tbl) olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon <em>each</em> paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (tsp) kosher salt</li>
        <li><a href=sauce1.html>Parmesan Cream Sauce</a></li>
        <li>8 ounces (oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>Finely chopped parsley, to garnish</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>If frozen, thaw shrimp</li>
        <li><em>Cook the pasta:</em>Start a pot of well salted water to a boil. Boil the pasta until it is just al dente. Start tasting a few minutes before the package recommends: you want it to be tender but still a little firm on the inside; usually around 7 to 8 minutes. Drain the pasta. (If it finishes before the sauce, add it back to the pot with a drizzle of olive oil so it doesn’t stick.)</li>
        <li><em>Cook the shrimp:</em>Pat the shrimp dry. In a medium bowl, mix the shrimp with the spices. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil on medium high heat. Cook the shrimp for 1 to 2 minutes per side until opaque and cooked through, turning them with tongs. Set them aside.</li>
        <li><em>Make the sauce:</em>Wipe out the skillet. In the same skillet make the <a href=sauce1.html> Parmesan Cream Sauce</a></li>
        <li><em>Serve:</em>When the sauce is done, add the noodles to the skillet with the sauce. (For the Cream Sauce only, add a splash or two of milk to loosen the sauce and come to just the right creamy consistency.) Then add the shrimp and toss until it’s warmed through. Taste and a few more pinches of salt, if necessary. Remove from the heat. Garnish with finely chopped parsley and lemon wedges. Serve immediately.</li>
     </ol>
