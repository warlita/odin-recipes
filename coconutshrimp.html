<p><strong>Notes about the Coconut Shrimp...</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Freezing Instructions:</strong>Fried coconut shrimp freezes well, up to 2 months. Reheat for 10 minutes in a 350°F (177°C) oven or until thawed and warm.</li>
    <li><strong>Shrimp: Large + raw shrimp with tails attached</strong>are best for this coconut shrimp recipe. If frozen, thaw before starting. I recommend getting them peeled and deveined because that will save you time at home. I recommend tails attached because the coconut shrimp are easy to prep, coat, and handle as an appetizer that way. Feel free to remove the tails before starting if desired. Can I use frozen cooked shrimp? Yes, you can use frozen cooked shrimp in this recipe but starting with raw shrimp is best. Thaw, then use in this recipe as directed.</li>
    <li><strong>Oil:</strong>We prefer frying the coconut shrimp in coconut oil for the best taste. You need enough to coat the bottom of your skillet, usually about 3 Tablespoons or close to 4.</li>
